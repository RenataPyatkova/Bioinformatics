**First take a look at Article1, then proceed to Article2, there you will find comparison and summary of results!**

The **aim** of this work was to determine the presence or absence of correlation between transcriptomic and
lipid profiles in patients with schizophrenia and depression, as well as to investigate the
functional association between gene expression and lipids.

The following objectives were formulated to achieve the goal:

- Analyzing data on the expression level of genes described in previously
published articles (two articles, each alaysis in a separate notebook)
- Analyzing data on lipid representation in the studied
brain regions (this part of research is not published due to confidentiality issues)
- Integration of transcriptome and lipidome results
- Functional annotation of results
  
The main **result** of the study is the finding of a high level of correlation between diseases in the anterior cingulate cortex (for lipids) and in the
contiguous nucleus (for the transcriptome). Key biological processes in which abnormally expressed genes are involved are immune response, lipid metabolism and cell cycle.
